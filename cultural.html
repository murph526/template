<p>As we all know, there is a laundry list of social issues in today’s society. One of the most prominent social issues in today’s society is poverty. Poverty affects people all around the world, including the United States. Poverty, along with many other social issues, has been shown throughout various types of today’s technology including movies, TV shows, videos games, etc. One form of technology that poverty is shown through is the TV show Shameless. The popular TV show depicts the south side of Chicago as a place of poverty with people that are lower class and come from bad backgrounds. Chicago is a city that has a very high rate of poverty and Shameless shows how poverty affects their lives and shows the difficulties they face on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Poverty has been an issue for a very long time in the United States. According to Merriam-Webster dictionary, today’s definition of the word poverty is “the state of one who lacks a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions.” Due to the socially acceptable amount of money changing throughout the years the rates of poverty have obviously changed, but it has still always been a prominent issue. Poverty in America is much different than poverty in other Countries. Americans that are considered in poverty when they don’t make a certain amount of money that they can stably support themselves with. In other countries, poverty is totally absolute. Where exactly is the poverty line? According to the US Department of Health and Human Services, for a family of 4 the poverty line is at 23,850. This seems like an amount that is no problem to obtain to most of us, but to others with families and no stable job, this is not such an easy amount to make. There is not one single thing that has caused poverty in our country. “More than 46 million Americans live in poverty” (PovertyUSA).  Many different things have caused many Americans to be in poverty. Some of the leading causes of poverty are taxes, low minimum wages, and unemployment. Poverty affects people in many different ways. In today’s society, most jobs with good incomes require some sort of a college degree. This is why education is a must for children because without it, in their adult lives they will not be able to find a good paying job and will again, suffer from poverty.  Poverty also effects people’s health. Without being able to pay for health insurance, medicine, or even being able to eat healthy foods, people can end up becoming very ill, or ultimately end up dead. As you can see, poverty effects much more than just not being able to buy new clothes, or being able to go to a concert for a band you have always wanted to see. It has serious effects on people and needs to be put to an end. </p>
<p>Of course there are certain parts of the United States that have higher levels of poverty. The poverty level throughout the state of Illinois and more specifically, the city of Chicago, is at a very high level. “Chicago has the third highest rate of extreme poverty of the nation's 10 largest cities, at 10.4 percent.”(Cottrell) Why is this; what is causing Chicago to be ranked the third highest city with poverty? It could be many different things including the low job market, low minimum wages, etc. Like I stated earlier, there really is not just one specific cause of poverty. But poverty does have many effects on people, one being an inclination to cause crimes. Because people are in need of money, this makes people result to bad things, like drugs and crimes. This is why crime rate is so high in Chicago. “The city of Chicago registered more homicides than any city in the nation in 2012.”(Wilson) This is an unsettling statistic for those of us that live in Chicago. Any city that has high poverty rates are at more of a risk for more crime. Crime is just one example of the many effects poverty has on the city of Chicago, but is one of the most prevalent ones. The TV show Shameless shows many crimes the family has been inclined to do because of their low amount of money. Shameless gives viewers a piece of what it is like to live in Chicago, Illinois and also live in poverty through their everyday lives. </p>
<p>The TV show Shameless takes place in the south side of Chicago with a family of six children, an alcoholic father with no job, and a bipolar mother that has left the family. All six of the Gallagher children ages range from one to twenty one. Due to a lack of a responsible father figure and a mother that is never around, Fiona, the oldest child, has taken custody of the rest of the children in the family. With only her GED Fiona is responsible to have a stable income along with caring for her five siblings and providing them with a home. As a family with no stable income from their alcoholic father and bipolar disappearing mother, the children all work doing small jobs around the neighborhood to support their family, including the child of ten years. Not only is it an issue to make money, but the Gallagher’s also have the issue of their father trying to always get money from them to buy drugs or alcohol. Throughout the TV show there are many problems and difficulties that the Gallagher family faces including almost losing their home, temporary foster parents, and many others. This family has many issues that are mostly all stemmed from to poverty.</p>
<p>In the TV show shameless, it specifically shows poverty in the south side of Chicago and the affects that it has on one’s life. Because the oldest child, Fiona, only has her GED, and has five children to care for, she is not able to find a stable job. This has left her unable to support her family alone and causes a very hectic home life. This results in her younger siblings having to work jobs in order to even keep their home and be able to eat. Together with all their earnings, they make it work, but this is not how it should be. Children at the age of 15 and younger should not be working to support their families. Some of the younger children are even skipping school to be able to help around the house with money. Obviously children that come from a family with poverty need good educations, or they will be stuck in poverty for their adult lives. This is an example of how poverty can affect children’s educations. Unfortunately, some families that are in poverty have to result to this. It is not easy for Fiona to find a stable paying job when she has the job of being a single mother at the age of 21. Frank, their father, has even resulted in cashing his dead Aunts checks after not reporting her death to anyone. Some people would think that a father would give money to his family, especially when they are in poverty, but not Frank Gallagher. He chooses instead to spend his money to keep up with his drinking habits and for his drug usage. This TV show lets viewers see that poverty affects people in many ways</p>
<p>Of course ending all of poverty is nearly impossible. If there were just one simple thing our nation could do to end it, we would have already. But just because we cannot completely defeat the social issue of poverty does not mean that we cannot do anything to lower the levels of it. For example, creating new job opportunities in areas with high poverty levels would be a great way to decrease the poverty rate by a large factor. Many people in today’s world do not have easy lives. Many people have families to care for, are unable to afford education expenses, etc. Creating more jobs that are more lenient with times and do not require high levels of education can cause a serious decline in today’s poverty levels. Take Fiona Gallagher for example, if she was able to have a steady job with a decent pay and be able to care for her 5 siblings, her and her family would have a good chance of getting out of poverty. Now, a job with those conditions is nearly impossible to find in this economy. Especially with no form of college education, but imagine if it was not so impossible. There are many jobs that can be created for people with similar situations as Fiona. For example, pumping people’s gas. This clearly is not the most exciting of jobs, but people that are in poverty should be willing to take any job that they can to help their family. In the states of New Jersey and Oregon, it is actually illegal to pump your own gas. They do this for safety hazards, but also think about how many people could have a job doing just this simple task. There is an enormous amount of people that own cars in today’s world. Obviously, people need to get gas in order to drive their car. This job alone would put so many individuals out of unemployment. Think about it, if every state of the US had this law, think of how many people it would give a job to. Now of course creating more job opportunities would not completely get rid of all poverty, as some individuals are in poverty due to laziness, but it poses as a solution to decrease the levels. Another idea to lower the poverty rates in America is creating a cheaper education system. College tuitions are continuing to increase as the years go on. Why is this? Education should be available to everyone, not only those with money. If a college education was available to everyone, this would give way more people the opportunity to have a high paying job. Now some may say if everyone has the opportunity to a college education that the job market would be even worse than it is today, and it would be nearly impossible to get a job. That could be true, but not if we created new jobs. In many high paying jobs, there are many different tasks that one employee does. If that one employee doing ten jobs changed into ten employees doing one job, not only would that improve their specific jobs, it would also bring a lot of people out of poverty. Companies would have more employees to pay, but they could lower the salary per person and save just as much money. It is not right that in today’s world there are people dying from poverty and there are others that have more money than they know what to do with. Creating more job opportunities and having an easier route to obtaining a college education can do serious damage on the high rate of poverty in the US.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in today’s society we have a various amount of social issues. Poverty has been a social issue in our country for a very long time. Social issues, including poverty, are shown through many TV shows today are based off of many of them, including the popular TV show Shameless. Shameless gives viewers a taste of the poverty lifestyle in the south side of Chicago and shows us the types of issues they go through on a daily basis.</p>
