			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>As an incoming freshman, many do not know what to expect at a University, or even know anything about the major that one chooses when first enrolling. It is extremely important for students to know what they are expected to do while studying at a University in their field of study in order for them to succeed. The main purpose of this report is to give students that have decided or are thinking about choosing to go into the field of speech and language pathology (SLP) the expectations that this major has regarding reading, writing, and researching. Students need to know what is expected of them in their field of study before they begin getting into their major in order to be successful. </p>
