			<p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 15px; color: white">Creating more jobs that are more lenient with times and do not require high levels of education can result in a serious decline in today’s poverty levels. Take Fiona Gallagher for example, if she was able to have a steady job with a decent pay and be able to care for her 5 siblings, her and her family would have a good chance of getting out of poverty. The pumping gas example that I stated earlier could drastically affect the levels of poverty. There is an enormous amount of people that own cars in today’s world. Obviously, people need to get gas in order to drive their car. This job alone would put so many individuals out of unemployment. Think about it, if every state of the US had this law, think of how many people it would give a job to. Now of course creating more job opportunities would not completely get rid of all poverty, as some individuals are in poverty due to laziness, but it poses as a solution to decrease the levels. Creating a college education system that allows everyone to get a degree can also make a significant change in the poverty levels. If a college education was available to everyone, this would give way more people the opportunity to have a high paying job. Now some may say if everyone has the opportunity to a college education that the job market would be even worse than it is today, and it would be nearly impossible to get a job. That could be true, but not if we created new jobs. In many high paying jobs, there are many different tasks that one employee does. If that one employee doing ten jobs changed into ten employees doing one job, not only would that improve their specific jobs that they do for their companies, but it would also bring a lot of people out of poverty. Companies would have more employees to pay, but they could lower the salary per person and save just as much money. Just from simply creating new jobs and creating a new college education system that allows everyone the opportunity to get a degree, the poverty levels in the U.S. could drastically decrease.</p>
