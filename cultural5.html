			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>Of course ending all of poverty is nearly impossible. If there were just one simple thing our nation could do to end it, we would have already. But just because we cannot completely defeat the social issue of poverty does not mean that we cannot do anything to lower the levels of it. For example, creating new job opportunities in areas with high poverty levels would be a great way to decrease the poverty rate by a large factor. Many people in today’s world do not have easy lives. Many people have families to care for, are unable to afford education expenses, etc. Now, finding a job with those circumstances in your life is nearly impossible to find in this economy.  Especially with no form of college education, but imagine if it was not so impossible. There are many jobs that can be created for people with similar situations as Fiona. For example, pumping people’s gas. This clearly is not the most exciting of jobs, but people that are in poverty should be willing to take any job that they can to help their family. In the states of New Jersey and Oregon, it is actually illegal to pump your own gas. They do this for safety hazards, but also think about how many people have jobs from doing just this simple task. Another idea to lower the poverty rates in America is creating a cheaper education system. College tuitions are continuing to increase as the years go on. Why is this? Education should be available to everyone, not only those with money. It is not right that in today’s world there are people dying from poverty and there are others that have more money than they know what to do with. Creating more job opportunities and having an easier route to obtaining a college education can do serious damage on the high rate of poverty in the US. </p>
