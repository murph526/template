                        <p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 15px; color: white"> For our project we chose to do my cultural analysis project of poverty. This project is all about poverty in America and how many different types of people have been affected by it. Poverty is a very broad term, so when it came to composing our project it was fairly difficult to find one specific aspect of poverty to think about. Due to this fact, we chose to include many different ways that poverty affects people in America. Our project includes many different problems that come with poverty, and because of that my group and I were able to grasp a lot of different details that relate to poverty and get a pretty good understanding on it as a whole. Especially because we split up the workload and each of us looked at each detail of the project, we were all able to obtain information about poverty and really understand each aspect. We ran across a problem of being unable to find good reliable information for some of the topics that we originally planned on using. Also, none of us in the group really had any background on making a documentary or any of the programs to use. We want our audience to feel a sense of sympathy towards those that suffer from poverty and also want them to realize that stereotypes about people and families in poverty are not always true. We selected the topic we chose from my cultural analysis project because we thought that we all had a pretty good background on poverty and how it affects people. The most challenging part of our project was the actual structure of the video. Like I stated earlier, none of us have any background experience in using these programs.  We tried to take a systematic approach for majority of the project. We went through the outline step by step and we retrieved our information that was needed for the video following our outline, but when it came to actually composing the video we jumped around a little bit from beginning and end. Research about drug use and mental stability were the most challenging to find information on. We were unable to find a lot of useful information on these topics. The most beneficial research we had was about education, starvation, and hygiene. Our group interaction when completing this project was pretty productive. We all did our part and we all discussed what was going into the video. We collaborated and came to agreements on everything in the project. I found working in a group to be somewhat fruitful, but at other times it was unproductive. I feel like our project took more time then it needed to take due to slacking off and procrastination. Our project started off slow because it seemed like everyone was just waiting for someone to take the lead. After we got a good grasp on the project we were productive. I believe that we could have planned our work for this project a little better, but overall we worked through it and our project became successful. Like I stated earlier we did slack off a little in the beginning, but we got back on our feet and produced what I see to be a good project.  One thing I would have done differently is made a better outline with more specifics on it. I thought that our outline was very vague and because of that our project was harder to work at. I found the wide range of information that we used to be the most effective because it shows many aspects of poverty and how people are affected by it. We chose to separate our video into the different aspects of poverty. We used the program moviemaker to produce our documentary. We chose this program because majority of us have PCs and it didn?t seem like that hard of a program to pick up on. Overall I found our project to be productive and effective.</p>
