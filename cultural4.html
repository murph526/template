			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>Poverty has been an issue for a very long time in the United States. According to Merriam-Webster dictionary, today’s definition of the word poverty is “the state of one who lacks a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions.” Due to the socially acceptable amount of money changing throughout the years the rates of poverty have obviously changed, but it has still always been a prominent issue. Poverty in America is much different than poverty in other Countries. Americans that are considered in poverty when they don’t make a certain amount of money that they can stably support themselves with. In other countries, poverty is totally absolute. Where exactly is the poverty line? According to the US Department of Health and Human Services, for a family of 4 the poverty line is at 23,850. This seems like an amount that is no problem to obtain to most of us, but to others with families and no stable job, this is not such an easy amount to make. There is not one single thing that has caused poverty in our country. “More than 46 million Americans live in poverty” (PovertyUSA).  Many different things have caused many Americans to be in poverty. Some of the leading causes of poverty are taxes, low minimum wages, and unemployment. Poverty affects people in many different ways. In today’s society, most jobs with good incomes require some sort of a college degree. This is why education is a must for children because without it, in their adult lives they will not be able to find a good paying job and will again, suffer from poverty.  Poverty also effects people’s health. Without being able to pay for health insurance, medicine, or even being able to eat healthy foods, people can end up becoming very ill, or ultimately end up dead. As you can see, poverty effects much more than just not being able to buy new clothes, or being able to go to a concert for a band you have always wanted to see. It has serious effects on people and needs to be put to an end.</p>
			<p>Of course there are certain parts of the United States that have higher levels of poverty. The poverty level throughout the state of Illinois and more specifically, the city of Chicago, is at a very high level. “Chicago has the third highest rate of extreme poverty of the nation's 10 largest cities, at 10.4 percent.”(Cottrell) Why is this; what is causing Chicago to be ranked the third highest city with poverty? It could be many different things including the low job market, low minimum wages, etc. Like I stated earlier, there really is not just one specific cause of poverty. But poverty does have many effects on people, one being an inclination to cause crimes. Because people are in need of money, this makes people result to bad things, like drugs and crimes. This is why crime rate is so high in Chicago. “The city of Chicago registered more homicides than any city in the nation in 2012.”(Wilson) This is an unsettling statistic for those of us that live in Chicago. Any city that has high poverty rates are at more of a risk for more crime. Crime is just one example of the many effects poverty has on the city of Chicago, but is one of the most prevalent ones. The TV show Shameless shows many crimes the family has been inclined to do because of their low amount of money. Shameless gives viewers a piece of what it is like to live in Chicago, Illinois and also live in poverty through their everyday lives.</p>
