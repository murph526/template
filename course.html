                        <p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 15px; color: white">As we all know, technology is an enormous part of today’s society. Through this writing course we were asked to complete five projects in which they all had some relations with technology. These projects taught us students in the class how to become more advanced in our writing and gave us knowledge that we may need in future writing experiences. WRA 110 is a great class for students to take for their writing requirement at this University if they are interested in technology and how it relates to our lives.</p>
                        <p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 15px; color: white">The first assignment in the course was the lived experience project. This project was made for us students to take an event that has happened to us personally and to write about how it affected our decisions in choosing our fields of study. Students are asked to describe their major and their future occupations they want to have when older. One important aspect of this project that has to be kept in mind is the audience. Students have to make sure that their audience has enough background on their field of study to be able to comprehend the project. It is overall a simple project due to its informality. I would say that this is the easiest project of them all in this course. I really enjoyed this project because it was personal and gave us students an opportunity to reflect on our personal experiences that have impacted our own lives. I saw this project as beneficial because it was an easy start to the course and it gave us students a feel of what kind of writing is expected throughout the entire course. It also gave us the opportunity to write in an informal matter, which is rare in most college courses. I really enjoyed this project and see it as very beneficial to students in this course.</p>
                        <p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 15px; color: white">The second assignment required us students to, through the analysis of a cultural artifact, investigate a social issue and its importance in society. This assignment was called the cultural analysis project. Of course, it was again very important for students to provide their audience with the necessary background information on their chosen artifact to assure that their message was clearly understood. I enjoyed this project because it allowed students to talk about issues that our society suffers from as a whole. As we all know, there are far too many social issues in our society today, but due to that fact, the project was a little easier to write about. So many different types of technology today, whether it be T.V. shows, music videos, movies etc. show social issues. I found this project a little more challenging than the previous one, but it was overall pretty easy. The most challenging part of this project was the research that we had to do about our social issue. Although this project was a little more formal than the lived experience assignment, the content was still fairly easy to write about. I see this assignment as very beneficial to students because it not only allows them to practice their writing skills, but it also gives them an opportunity to really understand some social issues that are going on in our society today. </p>
                        <p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 15px; color: white">The third assignment for this class was the formal research project. For this project, students were asked to write about their academic discipline to provide new students with the information that their major entails regarding work load. Students were asked to interview two people, one person who teaches a course in their major, and also one person who practices a related field of study. Also, it was required to analyze one scholarly article and one trade publication related to one’s discipline. This project was much more challenging than the first two projects. There was a lot of research that had to be done in order to succeed in the project. The part I found the most difficult was the analysis of articles and interviews. It was challenging to put in analysis of the articles and interviews into an essay, but it was a very important part of this project and was needed to back up the arguments made. Overall, I would say that I disliked this project the most, not because of the heavier work load, but because of the challenges I faced from trying to incorporate the articles and interviews into my essay. This essay also has a much larger length requirement, which made it even more challenging. I believe that I learned the most from this project due to it being more challenging than the others. I find this project to be the most beneficial to students for multiple reasons. First of all, this is the most formal essay of them all. The writing is a more challenging style which allowed me to learn from it due to the fact that this is not our typical way of writing. Also, gaining the experience of interviewing people that are advanced in this field was very beneficial because it allowed students to hear details about their major from first hand experiencers. Not many people have much experience in interviewing others, so this project really gave me an opportunity to learn from because of that. The articles are also a very beneficial factor to because they provide students with more information about their majors that they may have not known before. Analyzing these types of articles are not always the simplest act, so it provides students with an opportunity to do something that they may have not done before. Overall, this project was challenging but defiantly the most beneficial to students. </p>
                        <p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 15px; color: white">The fourth assignment for this course was the remix project. This project required students to get into groups and pick one of the group members past projects to make a documentary on. It allowed students to strengthen the original purpose of the piece that they had written about. This was a very challenging project, for many reasons. Working in groups is not something a lot of early college students have a lot of experience in. Group projects may seem easy, but really I found it to be challenging. Everyone has to come to an agreement on every part of the project which can lead to harder challenges later in the project. Also, it is a possibility that some students in a group slack off and give other students all the work, which creates even more of a challenge. The other challenge of this project was the actual making of the video. Some of us may have background experience in working with cameras and video making programs, but others may not. In my group, none of us had any experience which made this project very challenging. We had to work together as a group to teach ourselves how to use these programs. It was a very challenging project, but I did learn a lot from it. Students had the opportunity to choose from a group members lived experience project, cultural analysis project, and formal research project to further go into depth in. Our group chose my cultural analysis project. I found this to be beneficial because it allowed me to further investigate into the social issue that I had originally chose and it also allowed my group to learn about the social issue. The most beneficial parts of this project was the team work and the video making. Working together can be hard at times, but it is important for students to gain skills in group work for their future education and also their future occupations. The video production was beneficial because it allowed us all to gain knowledge on how these programs work and how to put a video together. This is a skill that could possibly be needed in our futures, so it was great to get some background on it. This project is very challenging but it also offers students to gain knowledge and experience in things that other projects do not provide.</p>
                        <p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 15px; color: white">The last assignment for the course is the project that is currently being done. This project asks students to go back to their previous projects and reflect on them. This essay is one part of the project. The other part requires students to get into groups and as a class create a website to give future students advice about this class. I saw this project as challenging because of the second part of the project, the group work. Like I said earlier, it is not always easy to work in groups. Also, when working with the entire class it could be even more challenging. Parts of the project are split up so that separate groups can work on specific parts. This is nice because it decreases the amount of work that has to be done by each student. The second part of this project was beneficial due to the fact that our entire class worked together on it. This is an opportunity that this class gives us that not many others do. It is great to see as a class what we all took from this great course. Overall, I enjoyed this project and succeeded with the help of my classmates. </p>
                        <p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 15px; color: white">Overall, this writing class has been an extremely beneficial class to my academics. I have learned a lot of information about things I did not expect to learn about. This class was challenging, but due to that fact I learned a lot. Through the help of Dr. Daniels, I have been able to gain a great amount of experience and knowledge with writing. I enjoyed my time in this course and hope that future students will as well.</p>
                        
                        
                        <h1 style="color: blue; font-family: Bradley Hand ITC; font-size: 40px">Lived Experience Group</h1>
                        <p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 15px; color: white">Lived experiences project, which was the first project assigned to us was a new type of writing. This project required us to create a narrative explaining how a specific piece of technology has impacted our choice of our fields of studies. This is different than any other typical writing project, due to the fact that it required us to write about our own personal experiences and opinions about our visions and goals. Further, it also linked them to the reasons of choosing our majors. In addition, the minimum required number of words was at least 1200, which was relatively high amount or number for an experience report.Our purpose of this project is to identify both intra and interpersonal experiences within lived experience projects. As a group, we have discussed what we have learned from this project, especially how to lay out an academic writing. Apart from academic aspects, we also enjoyed the project as it was a sole opportunity to express our lifetime experiences.</p>
                        <p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 15px; color: white">Through this project, we learned how to write in detail. The university-required writing skills were much different to what we were required to write for our secondary education. Lived experience project was the first project we encountered throughout the course. The project required us to write down our personal perspectives and experiences, thus it was a different style of writing we were facing. Writing in detail was a major challenge for all of the students. Because the minimum required number of words were 1200, which was relatively large amount for a topic regarding personal experiences. As a result, our writing became highly repetitive. Dr. Daniels helped us a lot with fixing those problems. Since it required personal experiences, we had to write a narrative style of writings. Most of us were used to writing and discussing a given topic. Thus, we always wrote as a third person’s view. However, through lived experiences, we changed the view point from third person to first person. We wrote as a formal version of personal diaries. The essay was very likely to be informal, and our main goal was not to make the essay informal, but yet narrative. Also, because we had to recall our memories from past, it was important for us to describe our moments well. This was a hard part for us as our generation uses photos and videos to describe a past moment, however because we were asked to describe in words, we had to think thoroughly and deeply regarding our memory. The significant difference between ordinary writing projects we encountered and the lived experience projects from the WRA 110 was the presence of the web version. For our projects, we were asked to provide a web version of our projects. Unlike other web making sources, the page “github” was using the fundamental HTML sources to make a web page. For students who did not know how to make a homepage, this was a great challenge. However, Dr. Daniels helped us a lot to make and fix the webpages.</p>
                        <p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 15px; color: white">We also found out that technology affected our goals and visions. As we wrote about our own life experiences, we got to organize our pasts. At the end of the project, each of student had a clear goal and visions about their lives. Many students forget their initial mind set they used to have upon their arrival to universities. In terms of motivation through their lives, acknowledging their initial motivation is crucial upon one’s success. Through the project, many students were able to recall their promises they made before universities. When reading other students’ writings, we were able to indirectly experience what others went through in their lives. Each student had a valid reason of their choices of majors, and by reading them we were able to widen our knowledge. This also helped us to develop our understandings of others, which may act as a crucial skill as a society member.</p>
                        <p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 15px; color: white">This project has allowed us to develop our writing skills from a first person’s view, which was a new style of writing for all of us. However, Dr. Daniels allowed us to express our own thoughts and framed our overall quality and quantity of our writings. With Dr. Daniels’ help, we were able to achieve our maximum ability as students both academically and non-academically. For the other projects followed after Lived Experience, the lived experience project acted as a keystone to build our writing skills. </p>
