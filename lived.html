		<h1>Speech and Language Pathology and the iPad</h1>
		<p>As many people know, in today’s society technology plays a huge role. Whether it is checking your email, planning a vacation, or communicating with friends through social media, technology has impacted all of our lives. The list goes on with the endless possibilities that today’s technology allows us to do, but have you ever thought about how a piece of technology that is commonly found in an everyday home could change a life? The purpose of my project is to show how the technology of the iPad has impacted Speech and Language Pathology and why it played a role in my decision to become a Speech and Language Pathologist.</p>
		<p>The technology of the iPad or really any tablet has been a helpful tool for many tasks. The IPad is a tablet that provides many different types of uses and allows users to choose between thousands of different apps portably. Not only can it be used for music and games, but it can also be used as a helpful device in many careers and academic fields. With basically any tablet, you can choose from an extensive list of apps for almost anything, including things to help you with everyday tasks, for academics, or for your entertainment. There are apps for almost anything, from music and games to health and lifestyle, the iPad serves as a helpful tool for many things. I’ve always been interested in how just a little tablet could do so much more. Today’s technology has the ability to not only entertain us, but can also do something much more important like change someone’s life. </p>
		<p>My chosen field to study here at Michigan State University is Speech and Language Pathology (SLP). SLP is a field in which one diagnoses, treats, and helps to prevent communication and swallowing disorders in patients. Patients that are in need of speech pathologists include stroke patients, children with speech impediments, autistic children, and really anyone else who has problems with speech and swallowing. I chose this major because I love to help people have always cared about other people’s wellbeing. While growing up I was surrounded by caring people. My parents and brothers always told me how important it was to care for others. This lesson was with me in my childhood and has still never left me. When I was younger, I would play doctor with my stuffed animals on a daily basis, always tried to help my mom with whatever task she was doing, and so on. I was raised to put others before myself and to recognize how important it is to help others. My mother had a stroke about three years ago. Obviously, with her life on the line my family and I were scared to death. All I could think about was how can I help my mother through this and how can I help her recover. The doctors told us that she had lost ability to do things like simple math problems, speak words and sentences properly, how to write, how to swallow, and the list goes on. I remember printing out worksheets of math problems and giving them to my mother to do, showing her flash cards, and trying to get her to just say our names. All I wanted to do was help her. After she was released from the hospital she had a speech pathologist come to our house for therapy. This was the point in my life when I knew I wanted to become a speech and language pathologist. My mother’s therapist had gotten her to eventually not only speak again but say words and sounds correctly. This was a huge relief to my mother and my family. After seeing how drastically the therapist had changed my mother’s life, I knew I wanted to pursue a future in SLP. </p>
		<p>In SLP today, pathologists and therapists have been able to use the iPad to make the recovery process for patients much easier and more efficient. Yes, this piece of technology is not necessarily needed in this field, but it does provide a lot of different ways to do therapy and also makes therapy more efficient in many ways. There is an extensive list of different apps offered that speech pathologists can use for therapy. Some apps that speech therapists use in therapy are S/Z, AAC genie, icommunicate, and so on. Some advantages of using the iPad for some of therapy are time and cost saving, progress monitoring by the speech therapist, and motivation. People enjoy using technology, so they will be motivated to do their therapy on the iPad. Especially for children, some apps that speech pathologists use for therapy are in the form of games. Not only are the children being entertained, but they are also going through therapy. iPads allow patients to not have a limit on their therapy time. They can simply use it whenever they want throughout the day. This is a beautiful thing because it can potentially speed up the process of recovery. Therapists are able to track a patients progress through some apps used on the iPad for therapy. It may just be a few apps on a tablet, but those apps have the power to drastically change someone’s life and help someone recover in an efficient manner.</p>
		<p>I’ve personally seen the benefits that the iPad has on recovering patients through my mother’s recovery. The stroke had a serious effect on her brain causing her to lose her ability to do many things, including swallow and talk.  She has been going through therapy for the past few years to attempt return to her normal state and be able to do the things she used to do before her stroke. She was meeting with her therapist a few times a week and was slowly recovering. After getting used to some of her normal functions, her speech and language therapist introduced her to the iPad and showed her many different apps that she could use speed up the process. This allowed my mother to do therapy even when her therapist was not with her. Her therapy consisted of meeting with her therapist multiple times a week, and also playing her games and using her apps on her iPad. Not only was the iPad very efficient for my mom, but she started to see improvement in the long run. Seeing my mother make such good improvements in her speech after having some of her therapy though the iPad has proven to me that the iPad is really an effective way for patients improve upon their disorders. The iPad allowed my mother to have different types of practice with different skills and served her as a great tool in the recovery process.</p>
		<p>We use technology multiple times in multiple ways every day. Technology is a huge part of our generation and changed all of our lives. The purpose of this paper was to prove that the iPad has had drastic effect on today’s generation of speech and language pathology and to show how the iPad has shaped my career path. Today’s technology has more than the power to just help us with our daily tasks, but to also help change peoples lives.</p>
