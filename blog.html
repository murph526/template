                        <p> The purpose of this video was for Uncle Ronnie's nephew to give him the message that his death
                        had affected his live in a huge way and that they were alike in many different ways. He wanted to 
                        let his Uncle know that he too was going through similar problems that he was while he was letting
                        his family and friends know that he was gay. He wanted to let his Uncle know that even though he
                        had hard times while he was going through this stage in his life, that it would have gotten better
                        like it did for him. His Uncle taking his own life hurt him because he was going through the same
                        things his Uncle was. His purpose of the video was to tell his Uncle that he didn't have to take 
                        his life and that things would have gotten better, like they did for him. Not only is this message
                        for his Uncle, but it is also for other people in the world that are going through these same problems.
                        It is to let them know that things do get better. The video achieves its purpose by showing the hurt that 
                        Uncle Ronnie's nephew had by even telling the story. His nephew telling his story and letting people see 
                        the things he had to go through shows people going through the same problems that things will get better 
                        and that it is not taking your life over it. It really achieves it's purpose by showing the hurt that his 
                        nephew went through and showing that eventually things got better for him. This message had an extremely 
                        strong messaage and was structured through the various ways he told the story. In the beginning of the
                        video he showed his letter he had written. He then shared a poem that really stood out to him and felt
                        that it reflected parts of his own life. Actually seeing him tell the story and seeing his pain when
                        telling the story really gets the message across to the viewers. This videos structure will help me revise
                        my Lived Experience project because I now have seen a story told with a sucessful structure that allows
                        viewers to stay engaged in the message that is trying to be shared.
