                        <p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 15px; color: white"> The purpose of this video was for Uncle Ronnie's nephew to give him the message that his death
                        had affected his live in a huge way and that they were alike in many different ways. He wanted to 
                        let his Uncle know that he too was going through similar problems that he was while he was letting
                        his family and friends know that he was gay. He wanted to let his Uncle know that even though he
                        had hard times while he was going through this stage in his life, that it would have gotten better
                        like it did for him. His Uncle taking his own life hurt him because he was going through the same
                        things his Uncle was. His purpose of the video was to tell his Uncle that he didn't have to take 
                        his life and that things would have gotten better, like they did for him. Not only is this message
                        for his Uncle, but it is also for other people in the world that are going through these same problems.
                        It is to let them know that things do get better. The video achieves its purpose by showing the hurt that 
                        Uncle Ronnie's nephew had by even telling the story. His nephew telling his story and letting people see 
                        the things he had to go through shows people going through the same problems that things will get better 
                        and that it is not taking your life over it. It really achieves it's purpose by showing the hurt that his 
                        nephew went through and showing that eventually things got better for him. This message had an extremely 
                        strong messaage and was structured through the various ways he told the story. In the beginning of the
                        video he showed his letter he had written. He then shared a poem that really stood out to him and felt
                        that it reflected parts of his own life. Actually seeing him tell the story and seeing his pain when
                        telling the story really gets the message across to the viewers. This videos structure will help me revise
                        my Lived Experience project because I now have seen a story told with a sucessful structure that allows
                        viewers to stay engaged in the message that is trying to be shared.</p>

                        <p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 15px; color: white">The group of people that this video targets is video gamers that are constantly playing video games. The social issue that is at hand is that people are letting todays technology take over their lives. In the video they kept on refering to the really powerful players as people with no lives. Some people with todays technology are letting video games and other electronics take up all their time. The boys all turned unhealthy by the end of the video because all they were doing was sitting at their desks playing video games. It is becoming an issue that people are letting video games and other electronics take over their lives. I think that the creator's view on this issue is people that allow video games to take over their lives are unhealthy and are wasting their lives away. He portrayed the powerful players as people with no lives. He obviously views people that put their lives into these games as unhealthy people with nothing better to do with their lives. </p>
                        
                        <h1 style="font-family: Bradley Hand ITC; font-size: 40px; color: blue">Blog Entry 3</h1>
                        <p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 15px; color: white">The Chrysler commercial for the Chrysler 200 portrays Detroit in a different way than most think of the city as. Detroit has been to hell and back and has had some very big down falls. The commercial doesn’t try to sugar coat what Detroit has been through, instead the creators chose to think of Detroit’s past as a building block that has made it a much stronger city. Because of this, the Chrysler 200 is seen to be a strong car. The song lose yourself by Eminem is included in this video due to the fact that he was born and raised in Detroit. Eminem is included to show that even though Detroit may be a not so great city currently, and even though it has had some hard falls, good can still come out of the city. Eminem is a very successful rap artist that is from Detroit. He has shown that Detroit is not a city full of failure. This commercial gives viewers a different perspective of Detroit that it is a very strong and unique city, just like the Chrysler 200. The tag line “Imported from Detroit” sends a very strong message to viewers. The definition of the word import from Merriam-Webster is to bring a product into a country to be sold. The main word that sticks out of that definition is country. Obviously, Detroit is in the United States, not in a different country, so why include the word imported? This is done to show how unique Detroit is. The US does not have any other city like Detroit. Detroit stands out, it is anything but ordinary. Detroit is like another country compared to the rest of the US. The creators included this to show how extraordinary Detroit is, along with the Chrysler 200. The main purpose of this ad is to show viewers how great of a car the Chrysler 200 is. By doing this, they compare it to Detroit, where the car is from, showing how strong and unique the car is, just like Detroit. </p>

                        <p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 15px; color: white">We were shown the class website and it is very organized and easy to follow. I am happy to see that this website exists because it allows us as students to go back and look at the assignments with detail in case we forget any part of an assignment. Our first project for this course is the lived experience project. This project is about a piece of technology that has impacted our choice of our major. We have a drafting activity that lays out major components that should be in our essay. I really enjoy the drafting activity because when actually writing the essay it helps a lot when thinking of the main components. The drafting activity is something that I would like to see for every project. I found it extremely helpful when writing the essay. This project seems to be simple due to the fact that it is a narrative and we will writing about our majors. . Also, we have learned how to create a Github account that allows us to make our websites. Github seems to be very confusing to majority of the class. I have never had to do anything relating to making a website along with the actual coding, so I think that this should be a challenge for me. Overall this course seems to be a class that I will enjoy so far, I am just confused and a little lost about Github and how to work the website but I am sure that I will get a hold of it the more we practice it.</p>
                        
                        <h1 style="font-family: Bradley Hand ITC; font-size: 40px; color: blue">Blog Entry 5</h1>
                        <p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 15px; color: white">We are currently still working on our lived experience project. We have had peer reviews to make sure that our content relates to the main points that the assignments asks. I found the peer review helpful because I was able to receive feedback on my work before submitting it for a grade. I also enjoyed peer editing other student’s papers because it gave me an idea of where other students stand in the course with their writing. I hope to see more peer editing further in the course with other assignments. We have been continuing to work on our templates with Github, but I am still very confused with how to work the website, I am hoping that we receive more explanation and help with the website and coding. I’m becoming more familiar with it but it is still very confusing for me and hard to understand the coding. We had an in class activity regarding a video of a young man who was gay and the troubles he faced with it. We were asked to explain the purpose of the video, how the video attempts to achieve its purpose, and the structure of the message. Our responses were to be added to our portfolio. I found this in class activity to be beneficial to students because made us pull information from a video and reflect on it with our own opinions. It also was a very inspirational video and I learned information from it that had nothing to do with WRA.</p>
                        
                        <h1 style="font-family: Bradley Hand ITC; font-size: 40px; color: blue">Blog Entry 6</h1>
                        <p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 15px; color: white">We have completed our lived experience project and are now moving on to our cultural analysis project. For the cultural analysis project we are asked to select an artifact of popular culture and explain how it depicts a social issue or a specific group of people. I am enjoying this assignment because I am learning more about not only writing, but also my cultural issue. I have chosen to do my cultural analysis project on the social issue poverty shown in the T.V. show Shameless. This project has allowed me to open my eyes to the fact that today’s technology shows many different social issues through television, movies, songs, etc. I am finding this project to be pretty easy so far and very enjoyable. We had an in class activity also about a social issue that was shown through South Park. This was helpful because it gave us an idea of what our topic should be like. Also, I just began to start our Codecademy requirements for the course. So far I have completed track 1, track 2, track 3, and track 4. It has helped with my knowledge of building the website and the coding, but I am still very confused with it. Codecademy is very helpful even though it hasn’t taught me everything I need to know. I have learned introduction to HTML, HTML structures, and introduction to CSS. This is a very helpful site and I would recommend future students to really take advantage of it. I do think that there is more information that we need to know that is not discussed on Codecademy that we should go over in class. I know that many of us are still confused with the website building. I think that we should have gone over more things in class about it and we should receive more help with it, especially because most of us students have no prior knowledge of any of this. </p>
                        
                        <h1 style="font-family: Bradley Hand ITC; font-size: 40px; color: blue">Blog Entry 7</h1>
                        <p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 15px; color: white">We are coming to the end of our cultural analysis project. Overall I thought that this project was very beneficial to me. I enjoyed it because of the information that I learned through my research on poverty. I really like that there was a web version template for our cultural analysis project. This really helped a lot when making the website. Without this I do not think I would have been capable of putting my work onto my portfolio. I also really enjoyed the peer editing, it helped me out a lot. Today in class we talked about Eming and Brummet. We were presented with a power point about their difference and similarities. We talked about Brummet’s three views of rhetoric along with a discussion of Eming and inquiry vs research. I thought that this power point was kind of dry and the information was not that exciting to learn about. As a result of this I did not pay much attention to the material in the power point. However, I did like having the power point to back up our reading on the material. The readings can be very dry and boring, but with the power point it provides a visual that allowed me to retain more information from rather than the reading. I just finished completing the track unit 5 for Codecademy. This dealt with CSS classes and IDs. Again, this information is helpful and good to know but still does not clear up all of my confusion in this course dealing with the coding and website production. I am hoping that my confusion will get cleared up soon through either Codecademy or explanation in class.</p>
                        
                        <h1 style="font-family: Bradley Hand ITC; font-size: 40px; color: blue">Blog Entry 8</h1>
                        <p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 15px; color: white">We have started to work on our formal research projects. This project asks students to create an essay that would give future students, new to our individual academics, information about the work load in the specific major. We were asked to include the expectations for writing, reading, and researching that take place in our specific field of study. We are also asked to conduct 2 interviews, one with a person who teaches courses in the field of study, and one with a person who practices in the field. Also, we are asked to do an analysis of a scholarly article and a trade publication that relates to our field of study. I think that this project will be much more challenging than our previous assignments. Luckily, we had an in class activity that helped me out a lot with this project regarding the articles. This in class activity helped us find the right articles for our papers by making us fill our certain criteria for each article. It also taught us how to search with a purpose by finding articles that relate to our papers with tricks we can use when we search for articles. This activity was extremely helpful not only for my paper, but for future classes as well due to the fact that I will have to find articles for other topics in other classes. I also started my annotated bib and have most of it done. So far the annotated bib has been pretty basic and simple.</p>
                        
                        <h1 style="font-family: Bradley Hand ITC; font-size: 40px; color: blue">Blog Entry 9</h1>
                        <p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 15px; color: white">I have set up meetings with my interviewees for next week. I will be meeting with my phonetics professor and will have a Skype interview with Lauren Finno, a SLP at a middle school in Chicago. I am hoping that I will be able to gather the information needed in order to successfully write my essay and help get my points across about the work load in this field of study. I have finished my annotated bib assignment and found it to be very beneficial. This assignment required us to use the five articles we used for our library activity and correctly cite each along with an annotation that identifies that main arguments of the articles and how they contributed to our projects. I am sure that annotated bibs and works cited will have to be used again in my future classes, so I found it to be a very helpful assignment. I found it to be a pretty easy assignment because most of us have had experience with annotated bibs before as well as works cited. Along with finishing the annotated bib, I have also completed track unit 6 for Codecademy. This included CSS element positioning. I found this to be very beneficial to me regarding the website production. So far Codecademy has been a very helpful tool with the production of my website. I think it is important for students to complete the assignments for it because of how helpful it really is. Unfortunately, I am still confused about the website production as a whole. </p>
                        
                        <h1 style="font-family: Bradley Hand ITC; font-size: 40px; color: blue">Blog Entry 10</h1>
                        <p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 15px; color: white">I have finished my interviews and have received a ton of helpful information for my essay. The interviews were a great experience for me because it not only allowed me to find more information on my topic of work load for SLP, but it also allowed me to give an interview which I have  never done before. This as a very beneficial part of this project because it allows students to conduct an interview which many students may not get the opportunity to do. I learned much more than just information for my essay from this part of the project. Overall, our formal research project has been a little challenging, but defiantly has provided me with a great experience and a gain on knowledge. I have finished my drafting activity for this project. The drafting activity for this project required students to write basically the core parts of the essay. Completing this will be extremely beneficial when composing the actual essay because it gives students and idea of a structure to follow in their essays. The draft is the most helpful part because it is basically a rough draft of all the ideas and information that is obtained for the essay. All of the drafting activities that we have had throughout the year have been very helpful when it comes to composing of the essay. They really give us an idea of what the essay should compose of in a general sense. I am continuing to work towards my final draft of this project.</p>

                        <p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 15px; color: white">We are just about to finish up our formal research projects, and I am basically done with my paper. I have some minor details to finish up, but for the majority of it I am finished. I am happy to see that again, we are provided with a web version template. These templates are extremely helpful for me when creating my website. Without them I would not have any idea of how to put my information onto my website. One thing that I am having trouble with is posting the pictures that I used in my formal research project onto the web template. I know that this topic was covered in Codecademy, but it is more complicated to apply it when composing of the website. I am also having trouble with my website due to the fact that some of the tabs will not work when clicked on. This is an issue that I am not aware of how to resolve and an issue that Codecademy did not cover. Overall I thought that this project was very beneficial to me as a student. It allowed to me gain experience in not only writing, but also researching articles and conducting interviews. This project was much more formal than the others in this course, but it was a good experience that helped me gain knowledge on formal writing. My favorite part of this project was the interviews. I know that I have discussed this before, but I really enjoyed getting the opportunity to conduct an interview. Not many students get to conduct interviews, we are usually the ones being interviewed. </p>

                        <p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 15px; color: white">We had a power point in class about visuals of information in videos and power points. We also watched some commercials and saw different tactics that were used to show information. Watching the commercials was very beneficial because it made me realize how important visual is. There are many different aspects that go into making a video. For example, when telling the side effects of a medicine, producers tried to draw your attention away from all the bad side effects and tried to make viewers pay attention to the people that were smiling and moving around in the actual video. We also had an in class activity about the Chrysler commercial with Eminem. We were asked to explain what the imagery of Detroit is in the video, the inclusion of Eminem’s song “Lose Yourself”, the tag line of “imported from Detroit”, and the voiceover in the commercial. I liked this assignment because it made me realize that commercial producers put a lot of thought into their work and there are many different aspects to creating a commercial.  We just began looking into the multimedia remix project for this class. This project give us the opportunity to revise and transmediate one of our earlier projects while turning it into a documentary. This is a group project that requires one of the members past project to expand on for this project. We can choose from either the lived experience project, cultural analysis proposal, or the formal research report.</p>

                        <p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 15px; color: white">We are working on our multimedia remix project and we have been assigned groups for this project. My group has decided to choose my cultural analysis project to use for the documentary. I chose poverty for my cultural analysis project and we are planning on expanding further into poverty and how it effects our society. We have started to create the framework outline for our project. We were given a framework outline to follow which is really nice because it gives us an idea of what our documentary should include and gives us an idea of what information to research. The framework outline includes core parts of what our documentary should have which will be very beneficial to us when producing our video. Like I said, we were assigned a group for this assignment. Working in group projects can sometimes be a challenge, but I am hoping that everything in my group goes smoothly. Our outline is off to a slow start but I think we will be okay once we start getting a full understanding of the project. We have decided to work together on everything for this project instead of assigning a specific part to each and every one of us. I think that this technique will work out best, even though it may take longer than just assigning different parts to different people. We also were given a documentary worksheet to fill out that will further help us with the details to add into our documentary and how it should be structured. Overall it think that this project may be challenging, but a good experience.</p>

                        <p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 15px; color: white">Our group has met once so far out of class and we have finished the framework outline. Although our outline was very vague, it gave us a general idea of what to build our documentary around. We began to look at what the main points of our documentary should be and began researching. We did have some confusion but we figured it out throughout the day. Each of us researched different topics at first and then we decided to all research the same topics to get as much detail as we could. This took some time, but we think it will be worth it in the end. Due to the fact that our topic is poverty, we had to make this broad social issue more specific. This was not easy and took some time to work thorough. We wanted to be very specific with a lot of detail with this project so the end result was successful. The information was not that difficult to find. We have been using many different reliable websites for all of our information and statistics. Because all of us worked together on the research, we were able to be very specific and have a good understanding on the social issue at hand. When we first started the project we were very slow and unproductive, but once we understood what we needed to do and had a good understanding on the topic we chose to do we did not have any trouble. My group so far has worked well together and hopefully continues to do so.</p>

This meeting took us five hours, but we covered the majority of the project. It took us some time to figure out how to work the movie maker. None of us really had any background knowledge on it and have never used it before. Actually producing the video has been our biggest challenge so far. Luckily, one of our group members got the hang of the movie maker program and did majority of the video production. I have learned a lot from this project so far, including things I thought I would never learn in a WRA course. I have gained a broad understanding of movie maker and have acquired a lot of information about how documentaries are made and what information they need. So far I have enjoyed this project except for the fact that I had no knowledge about the movie maker program in the beginning. Together as a group we all pitched in and were productive with the project. We worked together through our challenges and managed to finish the project very effectively. For this project we are also required to write a memo individually. This memo gives us a chance to reflect on our groups work and explain why we chose to construct our documentary the way we did. The memo includes our process of the project, our research, our collaboration as a group, and our design. I like that we are required to do this because it gives us a chance to let the professor know how we felt about our group and our overall project. </p>

                        <p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 15px; color: white">I had one last problem with documentary, the website. I had trouble posting our documentary to my website along with the works cited and the memo. We were not provided with a web template and we were not given any clear directions on how to go about it. I tried to look back at other templates and work from there but when I tried doing that it did not work. Throughout this entire course I have had trouble with the website. Personally I do not think that we received enough information about how to do some of the things for the website. Other than that I thought that the project was a good learning experience when it came to documentary creation, movie maker programs, and working in groups.  We finished our documentary and have moved on to the next project. We have begun to discuss the last project for this class which is the course retrospective project. This project asks us to reread the reports and projects that we have created this semester and take away five major goals. For this project there are two parts. The first part a write up of a final progress report for this course that will help incoming students understand the picture of first year writing to enhance their chances of success in the program. The second part is the class group project.  The second part of the course requires the class to create a website that informs and advises incoming students about this course. The website must include explanations of the past projects that we have done in this course.</p>

We have completed the draft part, which I found to be simple and enjoyable. I was able to look back at my previous projects and reflect on how much I have accomplished in this course. The second part of the project is the part that I find confusing. We are split up into different groups. There are two main groups, one is responsible for the content and one is responsible for the website production. Within those two main groups there are other minor groups. I am in the lived experience group and I am responsible for the content for this project. I am unsure as to what information I am supposed to be looking up. We are supposed to have material ready for the website designers regarding our specific group, but I do not know exactly what I am supposed to be doing. I have found this confusion to be a reoccurring event throughout this course. I have enjoyed the material that I have learned throughout this course, but many parts of the class go unexplained and as a result students get very lost and confused. I have started to look over others drafts that have been posted on D2L, specifically the lived experience portion and am hoping that I have the information that I need in order to contribute to this project. This has been my least favorite project of this course, but it is beneficial to us to look at our past projects and see what we have accomplished this semester. </p>

                        <p  style="font-family: arial; font-size: 15px; color: white">My lived experience group worked on our material in class today. Some of us were confused as to what material we had to gather at first, but we all came to a consensus about how to create the material needed for this project. We wrote a short essay about the things that we have learned from the lived experience essay and what we thought of the assignment. This was hard because some of the people in our group all had different views on the assignment. Eventually, we came to an agreement about what to write about for the assignment. This ending project gives us a chance as a class to work together and give feedback about our experience in this course. I like the idea of this project because it allows us to look back at our past projects and make us realize all that we have learned in this course. It is more challenging because it is a group project and students have to rely on other students to do their portion of the work. I am hoping that in the end this project will be successful. There has been a lot of organization with this last project and I think that because of the organization it will be a great success, as long as very student does their part of the work.</p>
