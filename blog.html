                        <p> The purpose of this video was for Uncle Ronnie's nephew to give him the message that his death
                        had affected his live in a huge way and that they were alike in many different ways. He wanted to 
                        let his Uncle know that he too was going through similar problems that he was while he was letting
                        his family and friends know that he was gay. He wanted to let his Uncle know that even though he
                        had hard times while he was going through this stage in his life, that it would have gotten better
                        like it did for him. His Uncle taking his own life hurt him because he was going through the same
                        things his Uncle was. His purpose of the video was to tell his Uncle that he didn't have to take 
                        his life and that things would have gotten better, like they did for him. Not only is this message
                        for his Uncle, but it is also for other people in the world that are going through these same problems.
                        It is to let them know that things do get better. The video achieves its purpose by showing the hurt that 
                        Uncle Ronnie's nephew had by even telling the story. His nephew telling his story and letting people see 
                        the things he had to go through shows people going through the same problems that things will get better 
                        and that it is not taking your life over it. It really achieves it's purpose by showing the hurt that his 
                        nephew went through and showing that eventually things got better for him. This message had an extremely 
                        strong messaage and was structured through the various ways he told the story. In the beginning of the
                        video he showed his letter he had written. He then shared a poem that really stood out to him and felt
                        that it reflected parts of his own life. Actually seeing him tell the story and seeing his pain when
                        telling the story really gets the message across to the viewers. This videos structure will help me revise
                        my Lived Experience project because I now have seen a story told with a sucessful structure that allows
                        viewers to stay engaged in the message that is trying to be shared.

                        <p>The group of people that this video targets is video gamers that are constantly playing video games. The social issue that is at hand is that people are letting todays technology take over their lives. In the video they kept on refering to the really powerful players as people with no lives. Some people with todays technology are letting video games and other electronics take up all their time. The boys all turned unhealthy by the end of the video because all they were doing was sitting at their desks playing video games. It is becoming an issue that people are letting video games and other electronics take over their lives. I think that the creator's view on this issue is people that allow video games to take over their lives are unhealthy and are wasting their lives away. He portrayed the powerful players as people with no lives. He obviously views people that put their lives into these games as unhealthy people with nothing better to do with their lives. </p>
                        
                        <h1>Blog Entry 3</h1>
                        <p>The Chrysler commercial for the Chrysler 200 portrays Detroit in a different way than most think of the city as. Detroit has been to hell and back and has had some very big down falls. The commercial doesn’t try to sugar coat what Detroit has been through, instead the creators chose to think of Detroit’s past as a building block that has made it a much stronger city. Because of this, the Chrysler 200 is seen to be a strong car. The song lose yourself by Eminem is included in this video due to the fact that he was born and raised in Detroit. Eminem is included to show that even though Detroit may be a not so great city currently, and even though it has had some hard falls, good can still come out of the city. Eminem is a very successful rap artist that is from Detroit. He has shown that Detroit is not a city full of failure. This commercial gives viewers a different perspective of Detroit that it is a very strong and unique city, just like the Chrysler 200. The tag line “Imported from Detroit” sends a very strong message to viewers. The definition of the word import from Merriam-Webster is to bring a product into a country to be sold. The main word that sticks out of that definition is country. Obviously, Detroit is in the United States, not in a different country, so why include the word imported? This is done to show how unique Detroit is. The US does not have any other city like Detroit. Detroit stands out, it is anything but ordinary. Detroit is like another country compared to the rest of the US. The creators included this to show how extraordinary Detroit is, along with the Chrysler 200. The main purpose of this ad is to show viewers how great of a car the Chrysler 200 is. By doing this, they compare it to Detroit, where the car is from, showing how strong and unique the car is, just like Detroit. </p>
