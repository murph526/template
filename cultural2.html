			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>As we all know, there is a laundry list of social issues in today’s society. One of the most prominent social issues in today’s society is poverty. Poverty affects people all around the world, including the United States. Poverty, along with many other social issues, has been shown throughout various types of today’s technology including movies, TV shows, videos games, etc. One form of technology that poverty is shown through is the TV show Shameless. The popular TV show depicts the south side of Chicago as a place of poverty with people that are lower class and come from bad backgrounds. Chicago is a city that has a very high rate of poverty and Shameless shows how poverty affects their lives and shows the difficulties they face on a daily basis.</p>
