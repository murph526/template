			<p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 15px; color: white">My purpose for my Formal Research Report is to give students that have decided or are thinking about choosing to go into the field of speech and language pathology the expectations that this major has regarding reading, writing, and researching. The discipline I will be researching is speech and language pathology. SLP is a program in which professionals specialize in communicative disorders and also swallowing impairments. Research is one of the most important parts in SLP. There is always more information to research in this discipline. SLP’s entire profession revolves around research. Major parts of research that are used in SLP is working with children in the lab and always finding out more information about children’s speech. Not only do SLP’s research by work in labs with children, but they also are always trying to find new information that can be beneficial to their work and any new improvements they can provide to their patients. Research in this discipline is a very common act. As a student going into this field, there is much research that has to be done in school. Students have to research many different things pertaining to hearing and speech, along with other aspects of SLP. Students will also work audiology labs researching information about sound. In this discipline students need to research all aspects that make up the parts of SLP. Communication is an extreme part of SLP as well. SLP’s have to communicate with patients on a daily basis. It’s the core aspect of the field. Students going into this field need to know that communication is the single most important aspect of this discipline. The most common type of communication in this field is the communication between the SLP and the patients. Technology plays a very important role in SLP. There are many different types of technology that are used in SLP. As a student, it is important to know that technology is a large part of how material is learned in this field. Working with audiology is probably the most common form of technology. SLP’s work in audiology labs to see many aspects of sounds when they are voiced. As an incoming freshman, many do not know what to expect at a University, or even know anything about the major that one chooses when first enrolling. It is extremely important for students to know what they are expected to do while studying at a University in their field of study in order for them to succeed. The main purpose of this report is to give students that have decided or are thinking about choosing to go into the field of speech and language pathology (SLP) the expectations that this major has regarding reading, writing, and researching. I will provide information on these topics from the help of an interview from SLP Lauren Finno, and Dr. Laura Dilley from Michigan State University. I also will include a scholarly article, and a trade journal backing up information. Students need to know what is expected of them in their field of study before they begin getting into their major in order to be successful.</p>
