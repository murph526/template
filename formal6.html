			<h1>Research Section</h1>
			<p>Research is one of the core aspects in the profession of SLP and also the schooling. There will always be more information to research in this discipline. SLP’s entire profession revolves around research. Without it, the profession would be non-existent. SLP’s research material pertaining to an endless list including what causes speech impediments and disorders, who is effected by theses communicative disorders, when is the most crucial time to attack these disorders and help patients improve, etc. Without having the knowledge found about this and also continuing to research, it would be nearly impossible to help patients with these issues. A major part of research that is used in SLP is working with children in labs. By doing this, SLP’s are able to tell where a child stands in their abilities of speech and language. Not only can this benefit the patient, but it also provides data that is used to help future patients. With research SLP’s are always finding out more information about children’s speech and providing themselves with new ways of therapy. Not only do SLP’s research children, but they also are always trying to find new information about speech and language in general that can be beneficial to their work and any new improvements they can provide to their patients in any way. Research in this discipline is an enormously common act. Dr. Laura Dilley, professor at Michigan State University, explained in an interview just how important research is in SLP. She went on to explain how SLP revolves around research, and about the research she has done in her experience with the field. When asked how often students are exposed to research, she explained how important research is in a student’s education of SLP and that it really depends on the exact courses one decides to take. She did also say that most SLP students will find themselves working in a lab at some point in time of their education, also possibly when they begin their careers. As a student going into this field, there is much research that has to be done while in school working towards a degree. Students have to research many different things pertaining to hearing and speech, along with other aspects of SLP. Students will also work in audiology labs researching information about sound. In this discipline students need to research all aspects that make up the parts of SLP. Research in this field can be extensive and challenging at times, but it is a very crucial part of the education. Having students do research while attending school, gives them a taste of what type of research is required in the actual profession. Along with research there are many other components that are incredibly important to the study of SLP along with the profession that students need to know about when thinking of this major.</p>
			<p>Reading is necessary for almost every major at a University. For students that decide to go into the field of SLP, there is a great deal of reading. Like every other major, there are textbooks that are required for certain courses. In this major, students will mostly be reading more into what they have been learning in class from their professors. Depending on what courses one takes exactly, this can differ, but overall students read to learn and familiarize themselves with the core aspects of SLP. Students will have to read a lot into the physics of sound along with some autonomy of the body that pertains to speech and language. Also, students will read about language as a whole and how humans acquire it during their lifetimes. The list goes on of information that is needed to be read and understood in this field of study. “I found myself having a good amount of reading to do in college while studying SLP… I had to in order to pass my classes and get the information I needed for exams” (Finno). Due to this information coming from a former SLP student from the University of Iowa, it proves that reading is an important part of education and is necessary to do well. Ultimately, as a student in the field of SLP, reading will take place in nearly every course. Reading is required to gain the knowledge of all the core aspects of SLP needed to succeed.  In order to learn about the core aspects of SLP, reading is required. For incoming freshman, it is important to know that keeping up with assigned readings in expected and is necessary to do well in a course and also overall in this field. Reading is also very important to the profession of SLP. Along with aiding patients with speech, SLP’s also help with reading. When reading something, the words are said in your head as you go along. If one is unable to speak those words correctly in their head, it makes reading incredibly challenging. This makes it important for SLP’s to have a basic understanding of reading as well as the reading abilities of children.</p>
			<p>Writing in the field of SLP is not as significant as research or reading, but it is still an important part of the major. There is writing in the field of SLP, but not as much as other courses require. There are courses that are mandatory to take for university requirements that include a writing class, but beyond that extent there is not an abundant amount of writing. Depending on the courses that one takes, this can of course differ. Students can be expected to write when a project is assigned by a professor. Rarely will this be an extensive essay, but it does happen. In the profession of SLP as well as the schooling, writing is common with research. Researching in any major requires a certain extent of writing, and because research is so prominent in SLP, students will be seeing a lot of it during school, and later in life. Not only is it important for students to know what is expected of them in the aspects of researching, reading, and writing, but it’s also important that they know how to succeed and what is expected of them to succeed as a whole in the major. Writing as a whole is very important in the profession of SLP. As a SLP, you may be presented with a patient that has trouble with communication through writing. Writing pertains to SLP, because in order to spell and make sentences one needs to be able to sound out words in their head. With this being said, it is important for students to know about grammar and language in a writing sense in order to provide their patients with  but the amount of work doing actual writing in the schooling for SLP is not an extravagant amount. In order to succeed in this field, students need to complete the required writing assignments that are assigned throughout their college career.</p>
			<p>It is possible to succeed by getting by with the bare minimum amount of work put towards ones studies in college, but to really succeed in the real world in this profession, there is much more than doing the bare minimum. When studying SLP, it is important to take all of the correct courses that will make you prepared and knowledgeable for your future as a SLP. University’s set required classes to be taken in order to graduate in your major, but this does not limit you to only taking those classes. SLP is a very broad field and as stated earlier, there are many different routes one can take in the field. Based on what route one wants to take, one can take courses that pertain to that specific route. This especially goes for SLP’s that choose to work in schools with children. Taking courses on how children learn and act can be very beneficial for ones work and also ultimately for the improvement of patients disorders. Also, further than just studying children in general, because SLP’s commonly work with children that has autism, it can be extremely beneficial to familiarize one’s self with autism in children. A scholarly article was written about a study that was done to ask SLP’s how confident they felt on their abilities to successfully provide autistic children with the correct therapy to help them improve on their communication disorders. The results showed that many SLP’s did not feel very confident due to their lack of knowledge about autism. This study has shown that the education system for SLP is lacking a major part of the profession dealing with autistic children (Schwartz, Drager). This article proves that it is very important for prospective students in SLP to go beyond the limit of just the required courses to take to graduate in the major. It is very important for students to know this information because it gives them a sense of what is expected of them to do outside of doing just what they are told.</p>
