			<p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 15px; color: white">Technology plays a very important role in SLP. There are many different types of technology that are used in SLP for therapy, and education.  As a student, it is important to know that technology is a large part of how material is learned in this field. Working with audiology is probably the most common form of technology. Students will be exposed to many types of technology used for studies regarding audiology. SLP’s work in audiology labs to see many aspects of sounds when they are voiced. Also, SLP’s work with patients they may need technology in order to actually hear, including cochlear implants, hearing aids, etc. It is important for students to be educated about these types of technology. There are also many other forms of technology that can be used in SLP. iPads are a form of technology that are used by SLP’s as a tool of therapy for their patients. Many apps are available on the iPad that can aid patients to improve on their communication disorders.  A trade journal by Sally Parker states that “The iPad and other tablet computers have revolutionized speech language pathology. Hundreds of apps are available for tablet users, and more are released every day.” This goes to show just how helpful today’s technology is regarding SLP and therapy. The iPad allows patients to be able to do therapy alone, in the comfort of their own home and is very convenient for SLP’s to keep up with their patient’s progress. There are many apps that have been made for SLP. <img src="www.rehabalternatives.com/blogspot/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/3-fabf34d9d1.jpg"> As seen in the graph provided by Nina S. from Rehab Alternatives, it shows a few apps that have been made for speech therapy along with the area of therapy and price. The iPad, along with other tablets are very convenient regarding price. The graph compares the price of apps to the price of the traditional product that would be used without the use of the iPad. “In the classroom, I usually do not use much technology unless it is on the projector for everyone to see, but I know of many parents of the children have purchased different apps for their children to use at home” (Finno). Clearly, tablets have made it possible for patients to go through therapy with an affordable price. Technology has a massive impact on SLP’s and their work with their patients. </p>
