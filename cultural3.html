			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>The TV show Shameless takes place in the south side of Chicago with a family of six children, an alcoholic father with no job, and a bipolar mother that has left the family. All six of the Gallagher children ages range from one to twenty one. Due to a lack of a responsible father figure and a mother that is never around, Fiona, the oldest child, has taken custody of the rest of the children in the family. With only her GED Fiona is responsible to have a stable income along with caring for her five siblings and providing them with a home. As a family with no stable income from their alcoholic father and bipolar disappearing mother, the children all work doing small jobs around the neighborhood to support their family, including the child of ten years. Not only is it an issue to make money, but the Gallagher’s also have the issue of their father trying to always get money from them to buy drugs or alcohol. Throughout the TV show there are many problems and difficulties that the Gallagher family faces including almost losing their home, temporary foster parents, and many others. This family has many issues that are mostly all stemmed from to poverty.</p>
			<p>In the TV show shameless, it specifically shows poverty in the south side of Chicago and the affects that it has on one’s life. Because the oldest child, Fiona, only has her GED, and has five children to care for, she is not able to find a stable job. This has left her unable to support her family alone and causes a very hectic home life. This results in her younger siblings having to work jobs in order to even keep their home and be able to eat. Together with all their earnings, they make it work, but this is not how it should be. Children at the age of 15 and younger should not be working to support their families. Some of the younger children are even skipping school to be able to help around the house with money. Obviously children that come from a family with poverty need good educations, or they will be stuck in poverty for their adult lives. This is an example of how poverty can affect children’s educations. Unfortunately, some families that are in poverty have to result to this. It is not easy for Fiona to find a stable paying job when she has the job of being a single mother at the age of 21. Frank, their father, has even resulted in cashing his dead Aunts checks after not reporting her death to anyone. Some people would think that a father would give money to his family, especially when they are in poverty, but not Frank Gallagher. He chooses instead to spend his money to keep up with his drinking habits and for his drug usage. This TV show lets viewers see that poverty affects people in many ways.</p>
