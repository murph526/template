			<p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 15px; color: white">It’s immensely important to know what the major one chooses entails exactly. Speech and language pathologists specialize in communicative disorders and also swallowing impairments. SLP’s treat children and adults who have these disorders and provide patients with diagnosis and therapy. SLP’s are extremely important in many different ways and the occupation is in very high demand. In the graph provided by healthcare-schools-online.com, it is clearly shown that the need for SLP’s is continuing to rise very rapidly.<img src="http://www.healthcare-schools-online.com/Images/charts/slp-ProjectedGrowth.jpg"> There will always be people that have communicative disorders that are in need of SLP’s, therefore the profession will continue to grow and stay in high demand. In the field of SLP there are many different routes to take. SLP’s have the opportunities to work in schools, hospitals, doctor’s offices, or in labs. Also, this profession can include traveling, or working from home. SLP is also a very satisfying job, ranked in the top twenty five most meaningful and satisfying professions in today’s society (Forbes.com). While interviewing Lauren Finno, Speech and Language Pathologist, the question “what made you choose SLP as your profession, and why do you think it is important?” was asked, Lauren replied, “I chose SLP because communicative disorders pay serious tolls on people’s lives, and many people suffer from these disorders. I knew all my life that I have wanted to help others, and SLP has allowed me to accomplish that goal.” This goes to show how passionate people can be about their work with SLP, and how satisfying of a profession it really is. SLP’s main purpose of their work is to give their patients the opportunity to enhance their communication skills, or any other disability they have with speech and language. SLP is an occupation that improves people’s quality of life by helping patients improve on their disorders that may hold them back from many things in life. In the graph provided by The Communication Therapy Institute, it shows the positive effect going to therapy has had on patients with communicative disorders. As seen in the graph, nearly every client benefited from therapy by an SLP. <img src="http://stutteringonlinetherapy.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/graph939.JPG"> This goes to show just how effective SLP’s can be on their patients disorders.  During working towards a degree in this field, there is a lot of work that has to be done. This is not a major that is easy to get by with. This major requires a lot of effort and time to do well. There are many different things that are asked of you to do in this field, other than just showing up for class. In this field there is much work required to do. All college students obviously have to do work to a certain extent pertaining to researching, writing, and reading. In the field of SLP, these are all very important components when studying to get a degree.</p>
